## Project Summary

Our project allows users to interact with the “Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present” database in a meaningful way. With the data we have stored and our UI, users can search for crimes that occurred in Los Angeles by time and date, location (accurate only  to the nearest hundred block for privacy,) type of crime, or some logical combination of the previous traits.  

Our interface can provide a text-based output based on the input criteria that is sorted logically based on the inputs it has been given. More importantly, however, our interface can show a visual representation of the text-based output that will have more meaning to the user. The program will output a map of the LA area in which the crimes are distributed based on location, with a key that makes them distinguishable by density, type, time, or all three.
